  description: "We consider the problem of recognizing popular landmarks in large-scale datasets of unconstrained social images by formulating a classification problem involving nearly one million images.
In this work we emphasize a “large scale” data driven approach which differentiates it from many approaches which consider relatively small datasets and classification tasks."

  tags:
    - Software Development
    
  description: "Build a platform using indoor location based services from beacons to identify precise range and proximity of items. The items are located in indoor locations such as a consumer items in a retails store. Generated event based on user location and preferences. The goal was to provide this platform for both consumers and operation team. The outcome of the project was a client/server based architecture for all services and mobile applications for android, IOS."
